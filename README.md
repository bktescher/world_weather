## World Weather Module

The contents of this module feature an analysis of the world weather trends at this time.  
OpenWeathermap API website was utilized to form these trends.

Once the weather trends had been analyzed, it was our task to identify potential favorable vacation destinations. 
Client input was utilized to set the "favorable temperature parameters. Based on their feedback, we arranged a list of hotels in the cities within the favorable list.  

The final part of the analysis consisted of choosing a start and end point for the trip.  We also utlized the Google Directions API to map out three other cities for excursions during the trip.  

This was probably the most interesting and fun module yet.  I am sad that it is the end of the Python block as I am just now starting to get the hang of it.
